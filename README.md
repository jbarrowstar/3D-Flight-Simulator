# Getting started & controls
Hi! Thank you for checking out `The 3D Flight Simulator Game Project`. Thus far there is not much to do in the plane project but fly around and discover generated chunks that nobody has ever seen before.Up/Down changes your speed and Left/Right changes your direction.

# How to run a development copy of the project
This project ensuring all assets like plane images are properly organized. Use a local web server, such as VS Code Live Server or Node.js with http-server, to serve the project. Once set up, open the provided localhost URL in a browser to view and interact with the 3D Flight Simulator. This setup allows for smooth testing and debugging during development.
